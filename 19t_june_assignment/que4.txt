LIBRARY :-
1>  A library is a collection of code built to perform common tasks

2>  Library is written in same language  in which it is used

3>  Library code tends to be relatively stable and bug free.

4>  Use of appropriate libraries can reduce the amount of code the need to be
    written. It will tend to reduce line of code counts for an application
    will increasing the rate at which functionality is delivered.

5> Usually, it's better to use a library routine than to write own code.

6>e.g. Numpy is a library of Python for matrices & mathematical handling,
       math is a library to handle numberal operations


 API :-
 1>  API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code .

 2>  API can be written in any language

 3>  APIs should be defined before the code implementing them is implemented.

 4>  APIs should be stable, although portions of the API can be deprecated

 5>  The more broadly used the API the more difficult it is to change it.

 6>  e.g. Google Maps API for JavaScript, flickrj is API for Flickr in JAVA
     tweepy is an API for Twitter, spotipy is an API for Spotify
